# Contribute

Any contribution is welcome. Just follow those guidelines:

1. If you are unsure, open a ticket before working on anything
2. Fork and clone the project
3. Create a branch `git checkout -b feature/my-feature` (or `hotfix`)
4. Push the code to your fork
5. **Write tests and documentation. I won't merge a PR without it!**
6. Make a pull request from your new branch
7. Wait, I am usually pretty fast to merge PRs :)

Thanks a lot to all the previous [contributors](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-parser/graphs/contributors).

## Setup

```
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/i18next-parser.git
cd i18next-parser
yarn
```

## Development

The code is written using the latest ES6 features. For the cli to run on older node version, it is compiled with Babel. You can run the compiler in watch mode and let it in the background:

```
yarn watch
```

Don't forget to commit the compiled files.

## Tests

Make sure the tests pass:

```
yarn test
```

To test the CLI:

```
yarn link
cd test
i18next test/**/*.html  -c i18next-parser.config.js
```

To test gulp:

```
yarn global add gulp@next
cd test
gulp i18next
```

To test broccoli:

```
yarn global add broccoli-cli
cd test
rm -rf dist && broccoli build dist
```


## `0.x` vs `1.x`

`1.x` is a major release. It is not backward compatible. There are two separate branches:

- `master` for `1.x`
- `0.x.x` for the old version

I will not maintain the old version but will welcome bug fixes as PRs.

## Deploy

- `yarn watch`
- update `package.json` version
- create commit and add version tag
- `npm publish --tag next` (skip next tag if not in beta)
- create a github release
